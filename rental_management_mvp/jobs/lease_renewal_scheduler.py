# from ..models.user import User (to get Tenant contact info)

    # print(f"Running lease renewal reminder job for: {today}")

    # 1. Fetch active reminder rules relevant to lease renewals
    # active_lease_renewal_rules = get_active_reminder_rules(
    #     offset_relative_to=ReminderOffsetRelativeTo.LEASE_END_DATE,
    #     is_active=True
    # )
    # For demonstration, let's imagine active_lease_renewal_rules is a list of LandlordReminderRule objects.

    # for rule in active_lease_renewal_rules:
        # target_reminder_date = today + timedelta(days=rule.days_offset) # days_offset is negative for "before"
        # if rule.days_offset >= 0: # Only process rules for "before" or "on the day" of expiry for renewals
        #     # print(f"Skipping rule '{rule.name}' as days_offset is not negative (not 'before' expiry).")
        #     continue

        # Calculate the exact date a lease should end for this rule to trigger today.
        # If rule is -60 days (60 days before end_date), and today is reminder_date,
        # then end_date = today + 60 days.
        # target_lease_end_date = today - timedelta(days=rule.days_offset) # Since days_offset is negative, this adds days

        # print(f"Processing rule: {rule.name} (ID: {rule.rule_id}) for leases ending on {target_lease_end_date}")

        # 2. Find leases that match the rule's criteria
        # This query would be complex:
        #   - Leases belonging to rule.landlord_id
        #   - Lease.end_date == target_lease_end_date
        #   - Lease.status is active (e.g., 'ACTIVE', 'CURRENT')
        #   - Optionally, filter by rule.property_ids or rule.property_types if those fields are used
        # leases_due_for_reminder = get_leases_ending_on(
        #     landlord_id=rule.landlord_id,
        #     end_date=target_lease_end_date,
        #     # status_in=['ACTIVE', 'CURRENT'] # Or however active leases are defined
        # )
        # For demonstration, let's imagine leases_due_for_reminder is a list of Lease objects.

        # for lease in leases_due_for_reminder:
            # print(f"  Lease ID {lease.lease_id} (Tenant ID: {lease.tenant_id}) is due for reminder rule '{rule.name}'.")

            # 3. Avoid duplicate reminders
            #    - Check if a reminder for this specific rule and lease (and target_lease_end_date)
            #      has already been sent. This might involve:
            #      - A separate SentReminderLog model (log_id, rule_id, lease_id, reminder_date_sent, notification_type)
            #      - A field on the Lease model itself (e.g., last_renewal_reminder_sent_data: Dict) - less ideal for multiple rules
            # if has_reminder_been_sent(rule.rule_id, lease.lease_id, target_lease_end_date):
            #     # print(f"    Reminder already sent for Lease ID {lease.lease_id} and Rule ID {rule.rule_id}.")
            #     continue

            # 4. Prepare and send notification
            #    - Get Tenant's User object to find email/phone for notification.
            # tenant = get_user_by_id(lease.tenant_id)
            # landlord = get_user_by_id(lease.landlord_id) # For CC or if reminder is to landlord

            # if not tenant:
            #     # print(f"    Tenant ID {lease.tenant_id} not found. Cannot send reminder.")
            #     continue

            # Notification details:
            # recipient_user_id = tenant.user_id
            # notification_type = determine_notification_type_from_template(rule.template_id) # e.g., 'EMAIL', 'SMS'
            # message_context = {
            #     "tenant_name": tenant.first_name,
            #     "landlord_name": landlord.first_name, # Or company name
            #     "lease_end_date": lease.end_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
            #     "days_remaining": -rule.days_offset, # Make it positive
            #     "property_address": lease.property.address_line_1, # Assuming lease has property info
            #     # ... other details needed by the template
            # }

            # print(f"    Attempting to send {notification_type} reminder to Tenant ID {tenant.user_id} using Template ID {rule.template_id}.")
            # success = send_notification(
            #     recipient_user_id=recipient_user_id,
            #     template_id=rule.template_id, # Or use a specific message if template_id is not for content
            #     context=message_context,
            #     # type=notification_type # If send_notification handles dispatch to email/sms based on type
            # )

            # if success:
            #     # print(f"    Reminder sent successfully for Lease ID {lease.lease_id} / Rule ID {rule.rule_id}.")
            #     # Log that the reminder was sent to prevent duplicates
