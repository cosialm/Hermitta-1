    #    b. Calculate total rent paid by the tenant for that lease where `payment_date` <= `as_of_date` and status is 'COMPLETED'.
    #    c. Arrears = Total Expected Rent - Total Rent Paid.
    #    d. Only include leases with Arrears > 0.
    # 3. Details for each arrears record: Tenant name, Property details, Lease ID, Expected Rent, Paid Rent, Arrears Amount,
    #    Last Payment Date, Days Overdue (calculated from the oldest unmet due date or lease start if no payment).

# Note: All report endpoints should consider offering data export options (e.g., CSV, PDF).
# This can be handled by query parameters (e.g., ?format=csv) or content negotiation.

# Example (conceptual):
# from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify
# report_bp = Blueprint('reports', __name__, url_prefix='/reports')
#
# # ... (routes for basic reports) ...
#
# @report_bp.route('/landlord-portfolio-summary', methods=['GET'])
# def portfolio_summary_route():
#     # Call get_landlord_portfolio_summary_report logic
#     return jsonify({"report_name": "Portfolio Summary", "data": {}}), 200
#
# @report_bp.route('/tenant-turnover-rate', methods=['GET'])
# def turnover_rate_route():
#     # Call get_tenant_turnover_rate_report logic
#     return jsonify({"report_name": "Tenant Turnover Rate", "rate": 0.0}), 200
