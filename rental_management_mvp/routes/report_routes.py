# Placeholder for Financial and Operational Reports API Endpoints
# Actual implementation would use a web framework like Flask or FastAPI

# Note: All report endpoints should consider offering data export options (e.g., CSV, PDF).
# This can be handled by query parameters (e.g., ?format=csv) or content negotiation.

# Example (conceptual):
# from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify
# report_bp = Blueprint('reports', __name__, url_prefix='/reports')
#
# # ... (routes for basic reports) ...
#
# @report_bp.route('/landlord-portfolio-summary', methods=['GET'])
# def portfolio_summary_route():
#     # Call get_landlord_portfolio_summary_report logic
#     return jsonify({"report_name": "Portfolio Summary", "data": {}}), 200
#
# @report_bp.route('/tenant-turnover-rate', methods=['GET'])
# def turnover_rate_route():
#     # Call get_tenant_turnover_rate_report logic
#     return jsonify({"report_name": "Tenant Turnover Rate", "rate": 0.0}), 200
#
# @report_bp.route('/maintenance-effectiveness', methods=['GET'])
# def maintenance_effectiveness_route():
#     # Call get_maintenance_effectiveness_report logic
#     return jsonify({"report_name": "Maintenance Effectiveness", "data": []}), 200
