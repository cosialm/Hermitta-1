# Placeholder for Lease API Endpoints (Refined for Phase 1 MVP - Manual Onboarding Focus)
# Actual implementation would use a web framework like Flask or FastAPI

# POST /leases (Landlord manually creates a lease, effectively onboarding a tenant)
def create_manual_lease():
    # TODO: Implement logic for a landlord to manually create a lease.
    # Landlord only (landlord_id from authenticated user).
    # Request body should include:
    #   - property_id
    #   - start_date, end_date, move_in_date
    #   - rent_amount, rent_due_day
    #   - tenant_id (Optional: if tenant is already a User in the system)
    #   - tenant_name_manual (Required if tenant_id is not provided)
    #   - tenant_national_id (Optional but recommended)
    #   - tenant_phone_number_manual (Optional, if tenant_id not provided or to store a lease-specific contact)
    #   - tenant_email_manual (Optional, similar to phone number)
    #   - rent_start_date (Optional, if different from move_in_date)
    #   - security_deposit (Optional)
    #   - initial_scanned_lease_document_url (Optional, URL to an uploaded PDF/image of the signed paper lease)
    #   - notes (Optional)
    # Creates a Lease record. If tenant_id is not provided, this lease is primarily for record-keeping
    # until/unless a full Tenant User account is created and linked.
    # Response: Full details of the created lease.
    pass

# GET /leases (List leases for a landlord or tenant)
def list_leases():
    # TODO: Implement logic to list leases.
    # For Landlord (authenticated): lists all leases associated with their landlord_id.
    #   - Supports filtering by property_id, status (e.g., active, expired - derived from dates).
    # For Tenant (authenticated): lists leases where tenant_id matches current user.
    # Response: List of lease summaries (key details).
    pass

# GET /leases/{lease_id} (Get specific lease details)
def get_lease_details(lease_id: int):
    # TODO: Implement logic to get specific lease details.
    # Accessible by the Landlord who owns the lease, or the Tenant linked via tenant_id.
    # Response: Full lease details.
    pass

# PUT /leases/{lease_id} (Update lease details)
def update_lease_details(lease_id: int):
    # TODO: Implement logic to update lease details.
    # Landlord only.
    # For MVP, this might be used to update notes, extend end_date (renewal),
    # or upload/change initial_scanned_lease_document_url.
    # More complex updates (e.g., rent_amount mid-term) would typically mean a new lease or addendum.
    # Request: Fields to be updated (e.g., end_date, notes, initial_scanned_lease_document_url).
    # Response: Full updated lease details.
    pass

# Example (conceptual):
# from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify
# # from ..models.lease import Lease
#
# lease_bp = Blueprint('leases', __name__, url_prefix='/leases')
#
# @lease_bp.route('', methods=['POST'])
# def create_lease_route():
#     # data = request.get_json()
#     # landlord_id = get_current_user_id()
#     # Create Lease object with fields: property_id, start_date, end_date, move_in_date, rent_amount, etc.
#     # tenant_name_manual, tenant_national_id, initial_scanned_lease_document_url, etc.
#     # lease.save()
#     return jsonify({"message": "Lease created successfully", "lease_id": 1, "details": "{...}"}), 201
#
# @lease_bp.route('', methods=['GET'])
# def list_leases_route():
#     # user = get_current_user()
#     # if user.role == UserRole.LANDLORD:

#     #    return jsonify({"error": "Unauthorized"}), 403
#     return jsonify([{"lease_id": 1, "property_id": 101, "tenant_name": "David Tenant"}]), 200 # Placeholder
