# Placeholder for Notification API Endpoints
# Actual implementation would use a web framework like Flask or FastAPI

# GET /notifications (Get notifications for the logged-in user)
def get_user_notifications():
    # TODO: Implement logic to retrieve notifications for the authenticated user.
    # Supports pagination (e.g., ?page=1&limit=10).
    # Filters can be added (e.g., ?status=UNREAD).
    pass

# POST /notifications/{notification_id}/mark-read (Mark a notification as read)
def mark_notification_as_read(notification_id: int):
    # TODO: Implement logic to mark a specific notification as read.
    # Updates notification.read_at and notification.status.
    # Ensures the notification belongs to the authenticated user.
    pass

# POST /notifications/mark-all-read (Mark all unread notifications as read for the user)
def mark_all_notifications_as_read():
    # TODO: Implement logic to mark all unread notifications as read for the authenticated user.
    pass

# System Processes (Not direct API endpoints, but related logic):
# - Scheduler for Rent Reminders:
#   - Periodically checks for leases with upcoming rent_due_day.
#   - Creates Notification records (type: RENT_REMINDER, delivery_method: EMAIL, SMS, IN_APP).
#   - Dispatches notifications via integrated services (Email/SMS gateways).
#
# - Scheduler for Late Rent Warnings:
#   - Periodically checks for leases with overdue rent (past rent_due_day and no COMPLETED payment).
#   - Creates Notification records (type: LATE_RENT_WARNING).
#   - Dispatches notifications.
#
# - Dispatcher for various event-driven notifications:
#   - E.g., when a new message is received (NEW_MESSAGE).
#   - When a payment is confirmed (PAYMENT_CONFIRMATION) or fails (PAYMENT_FAILED).
#   - When a lease document is uploaded (NEW_DOCUMENT_UPLOADED).

# Example (conceptual):
# from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify
# notification_bp = Blueprint('notifications', __name__, url_prefix='/notifications')
#
# @notification_bp.route('', methods=['GET'])
# def get_user_notifications_route():
#     # user = get_current_user()
#     # Call get_user_notifications logic for this user
#     return jsonify([{"id": 1, "content": "Rent reminder", "status": "SENT"}]), 200
#
# @notification_bp.route('/<int:notification_id>/mark-read', methods=['POST'])
# def mark_read_route(notification_id):
#     # user = get_current_user()
#     # Call mark_notification_as_read logic
#     return jsonify({"message": "Notification marked as read", "notification_id": notification_id}), 200
#
# @notification_bp.route('/mark-all-read', methods=['POST'])
# def mark_all_read_route():
#     # user = get_current_user()
#     # Call mark_all_notifications_as_read logic
#     return jsonify({"message": "All notifications marked as read"}), 200
