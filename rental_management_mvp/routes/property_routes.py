# Placeholder for Property API Endpoints (Refined for Phase 1 MVP)
# Actual implementation would use a web framework like Flask or FastAPI

# POST /properties (Landlord creates a new property)

    # Landlord only (owner identified by auth token).
    # Request body should include:
    #   - address_line_1, city, county (mandatory)

# GET /properties (Landlord lists all their properties)
def list_landlord_properties():
    # TODO: Implement logic for an authenticated landlord to list their properties.
    # Retrieves all properties where landlord_id matches the current user.
    # Supports pagination.
    # Response: List of property summaries (key details like address, type, status, main_photo_url).
    pass

# GET /properties/{property_id} (Landlord gets specific property details)
def get_property_details(property_id: int):
    # TODO: Implement logic for a landlord to get details of a specific property they own.
    # Ensures property_id belongs to the authenticated landlord.
    # Response: Full property details as defined in the Property model.
    pass

# PUT /properties/{property_id} (Landlord updates property details)
def update_property_details(property_id: int):
    # TODO: Implement logic for a landlord to update details of their property.
    # Ensures property_id belongs to the authenticated landlord.
    # Request body can include any fields from the create_property endpoint.
    # Response: Full updated property details.
    pass

# DELETE /properties/{property_id} (Landlord deletes a property)
def delete_property(property_id: int):
    # TODO: Implement logic for a landlord to delete their property.
    # Ensures property_id belongs to the authenticated landlord.
    # Consider implications (e.g., if leases are active - may need to prevent deletion or handle carefully).
    # Response: Success message or 204 No Content.
    pass

# POST /properties/{property_id}/photos (Landlord uploads property photos)
def upload_property_photos(property_id: int):
    # TODO: Implement logic for a landlord to upload photos for their property.
    # This would typically involve multipart/form-data.
    # Uploaded photo URLs would be added to Property.photos_urls.
    # One of these could be set as Property.main_photo_url via the update_property_details endpoint.
    # Response: Updated list of photo URLs for the property.
    pass

# Example (conceptual):
# from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify
# # from ..models.property import Property, PropertyType, PropertyStatus (and Kenyan amenities)
#
# property_bp = Blueprint('properties', __name__, url_prefix='/properties')
#
# @property_bp.route('', methods=['POST'])

#     # landlord_id = get_current_user_id()
#     # Create Property object with fields: address_line_1, city, county, estate_neighborhood, etc.
#     # property_type, amenities, main_photo_url
#     # property.save()
#     return jsonify({"message": "Property created", "property_id": 1, "details": "{...}"}), 201

# @property_bp.route('', methods=['GET'])
