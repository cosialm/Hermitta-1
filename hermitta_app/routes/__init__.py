# This file makes 'routes' a Python package.
# It can also be used to import and register blueprints if desired,
# or that can be done directly in the app factory.

# Example of how blueprints could be imported here for centralized registration:
# from .user_routes import user_bp
# from .property_routes import property_bp
#
# all_blueprints = [user_bp, property_bp]
