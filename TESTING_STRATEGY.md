## Comprehensive Security Testing Strategy

This section outlines the various types of security testing that will be integrated throughout the development lifecycle and performed periodically to ensure the robustness and resilience of the Kenyan Rental Management System against security threats.

### 1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
*   **Explanation:** SAST involves analyzing the application's source code (or compiled binaries) without executing it to identify potential security vulnerabilities, insecure coding patterns, and adherence to secure coding guidelines.
*   **Purpose:** To detect vulnerabilities early in the development cycle, reducing the cost and effort of remediation.
*   **Example Tools:** SonarQube (with security plugins), Checkmarx SAST, Snyk Code, GitHub CodeQL, Veracode Static Analysis.
*   **Lifecycle Integration:** Integrated into CI/CD pipelines to scan code on every commit or build. Results reviewed by developers and security champions.

### 2. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
*   **Explanation:** DAST involves testing the running application from the outside by sending various inputs and observing responses to identify vulnerabilities that manifest at runtime. It simulates common attack techniques.
*   **Purpose:** To find vulnerabilities that may not be apparent from static code analysis, such as issues related to session management, authentication, authorization, and server configuration.
*   **Example Tools:** OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy), Burp Suite Professional, Acunetix, Netsparker.
*   **Lifecycle Integration:** Regular automated DAST scans performed on applications deployed to test/staging environments. More focused DAST can be part of CI/CD for specific API tests.

### 3. Penetration Testing
*   **Explanation:** Authorized, simulated cyberattacks on the application and infrastructure conducted by security experts (internal team or third-party specialists). It aims to identify and exploit vulnerabilities just as a real attacker would.
*   **Purpose:** To provide a comprehensive assessment of the system's security posture from an attacker's perspective and identify complex or business-logic flaws that automated tools might miss.
*   **Scope:** Application (web/API), network infrastructure, cloud configuration, M-Pesa integration points.
*   **Methodology:** Adherence to recognized methodologies like OWASP Testing Guide (WSTG), Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES), NIST SP 800-115.
*   **Lifecycle Integration:** Performed periodically (e.g., annually, bi-annually) and after significant architectural changes or feature releases.

### 4. Security Code Reviews
*   **Explanation:** Manual or tool-assisted review of application source code specifically focused on identifying security vulnerabilities, insecure logic, and deviations from secure coding practices.
*   **Purpose:** To catch subtle security flaws that automated tools might miss and to reinforce secure coding knowledge among developers. Complements SAST.
*   **Lifecycle Integration:** Integrated into the standard code review process (pull requests). Security champions or security-focused developers should participate. A security checklist should guide reviewers.

### 5. Vulnerability Scanning (Infrastructure & Dependencies)
#### 5.1. Infrastructure Scanning
*   **Explanation:** Scanning servers, network devices, operating systems, and cloud service configurations for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compliance deviations.
*   **Purpose:** To identify and remediate weaknesses in the underlying infrastructure that could be exploited.
*   **Example Tools:** Nessus, OpenVAS, QualysGuard, cloud provider's security assessment tools (e.g., AWS Inspector, Azure Security Center).
*   **Lifecycle Integration:** Regular automated scans of production and pre-production environments. Results integrated into the vulnerability management process.

#### 5.2. Dependency Scanning
*   **Explanation:** Identifying and analyzing third-party libraries and components (both frontend and backend) for known vulnerabilities (CVEs).
*   **Purpose:** To mitigate risks associated with using vulnerable open-source or commercial software components.
*   **Example Tools:** Snyk Open Source, Dependabot (GitHub), OWASP Dependency-Check, npm audit, pip-audit.
*   **Lifecycle Integration:** Integrated into CI/CD pipelines to scan dependencies on every build. Alerts for newly discovered vulnerabilities in existing dependencies.

### 6. Specific Tests for Key Security Controls (Functional Security Testing)
*   **Explanation:** Targeted testing to verify that specific security controls are implemented correctly and function as intended. This often involves simulating specific attack scenarios or misuse cases.
*   **Purpose:** To ensure critical security mechanisms are effective.

#### 6.1. Authentication Tests
*   **Key Functionalities:** Verify password policies (length, complexity, history, lockout), MFA enrollment and verification lifecycle (TOTP, recovery codes), session expiration (idle, absolute), secure cookie attributes, effectiveness of logout, protection against credential stuffing and brute-force attacks. Test all authentication flows (email, phone, password reset).

#### 6.2. Authorization Tests (RBAC & Object-Level)
*   **Key Functionalities:** For each user role, attempt to access resources and perform actions not permitted by their role. Test for Insecure Direct Object References (IDORs) by manipulating IDs in API calls. Attempt privilege escalation paths. Verify `staff_permissions` are correctly enforced.

#### 6.3. Input Validation Tests
*   **Key Functionalities:** Submit malicious payloads (XSS, SQLi, command injection strings) to all input fields (forms, API parameters, headers). Test for oversized data, malformed data (e.g., incorrect data types, unexpected characters), and boundary conditions. Specifically test file upload vulnerabilities (malicious file types, oversized files, path traversal in filenames).

#### 6.4. M-Pesa Integration Security Tests
*   **Key Functionalities:** Attempt to spoof or tamper with M-Pesa callback data. Verify secure handling and storage of M-Pesa API credentials. Test idempotency of callback processing logic to prevent duplicate transactions. Test rate limiting on STK push initiation.

#### 6.5. Error Handling Tests
*   **Key Functionalities:** Trigger various error conditions (invalid input, server errors, permission denied) and verify that user-facing error messages are generic and do not leak sensitive information. Inspect server-side logs to ensure detailed error information is logged securely and no sensitive data is exposed in logs.
