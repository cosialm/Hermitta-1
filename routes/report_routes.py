# Placeholder for Financial and Operational Reports API Endpoints (Phase 6: Advanced Integrations & Scalability)
# Actual implementation would use a web framework like Flask or FastAPI

# General Note for all report endpoints:
# - All should be accessible by Landlord only (unless specified otherwise, e.g. Staff with permissions).
# - All should ideally support common query parameters:
#   - `property_ids` (optional, comma-separated string of property IDs to filter by)
#   - `start_date` (optional, YYYY-MM-DD)
#   - `end_date` (optional, YYYY-MM-DD)
#   - `export_format` (optional enum: 'JSON', 'CSV', 'PDF' - default to JSON)
# - Responses for JSON should be structured data. For CSV/PDF, appropriate file stream.

# GET /reports/trend-analysis
def get_trend_analysis_report():
    # TODO: Implement logic for trend analysis report.
    # Query Params:
    #   - `metric` (enum: 'OCCUPANCY_RATE', 'AVG_RENT_PER_UNIT_TYPE', 'MAINTENANCE_COSTS', 'INCOME_PER_PROPERTY')
    #   - `period` (enum: 'MONTHLY', 'QUARTERLY', 'ANNUALLY')
    #   - `property_ids` (optional list)
    #   - `date_range` (start_date, end_date to define overall range for trend)
    #   - `group_by` (optional, e.g., 'PROPERTY_TYPE', 'COUNTY' - if metric allows)
    # Calculates and returns data points for the metric over the specified periods within the date range.
    # Example: Monthly occupancy rate for last 24 months.
    pass

# GET /reports/budget-vs-actual
def get_budget_vs_actual_report():
    # TODO: Implement logic for budget vs. actual report.
    # Query Params:
    #   - `budget_id` (required, FK to Budget model)
    #   - `property_ids` (optional, if budget spans multiple properties but want to see for a subset)
    #   - `period_start_date`, `period_end_date` (optional, defaults to budget's period)
    # For each BudgetItem in the specified Budget:
    #   - Fetches budgeted_amount.
    #   - Calculates actual amount from FinancialTransaction records matching category_id, property_id (if any), and date range.
    #   - Shows Budgeted, Actual, Variance (Amount and/or Percentage).
    #   - Can be summarized by income total, expense total, and net.
    pass

# GET /reports/export-for-accounting
def get_export_for_accounting_report():
    # TODO: Implement logic to generate an export file for common accounting software.
    # Query Params:
    #   - `export_format_type` (enum: 'QUICKBOOKS_CSV', 'XERO_CSV', 'GENERIC_LEDGER_CSV')
    #   - `date_range` (start_date, end_date)
    #   - `property_ids` (optional list)
    #   - `include_reconciled_only` (optional boolean, if payment reconciliation is a feature)
    # Generates a CSV (or other format) file with FinancialTransaction data mapped to the accounting software's expected schema.
    # This requires understanding the target software's import specs.
    pass

# GET /reports/landlord-portfolio-performance (from P6 initial outline, more comprehensive than dashboard summary)
def get_landlord_portfolio_performance_report():
    # TODO: Implement logic for a detailed portfolio performance overview.
    # Query Params: landlord_id (implicit), date_range.
    # Metrics: Total properties, units, occupancy rate, vacancy rate, avg days vacant,
    #          Total rental income, other income, total operational expenses, net operating income (NOI),
    #          Maintenance costs summary (total, per unit),
    #          Lease renewals upcoming, lease expirations.
    # May involve complex aggregations, potentially using pre-calculated summary tables (data warehousing concept).
    pass

# GET /reports/tenant-turnover-analytics (from P6 initial outline, more detailed)
def get_tenant_turnover_analytics_report():
    # TODO: Implement logic for tenant turnover analysis.
    # Query Params: property_ids, date_range.
    # Metrics: Turnover rate (%), number of move-ins, number of move-outs,
    #          Average tenancy duration, reasons for move-out (if data collected).
    pass

# GET /reports/maintenance-cost-and-effectiveness (from P6 initial outline, more detailed)
def get_maintenance_analysis_report():
    # TODO: Implement logic for maintenance cost and effectiveness analysis.
    # Query Params: property_ids, date_range, category_id (optional), priority (optional).
    # Metrics: Avg time to resolve (by priority/category), total costs (by property/category/vendor),
    #          Number of requests per property/unit, recurring issues (by analyzing descriptions/categories over time).
    pass

# Note on "Simple Report Builder" API (POST /reports/custom):
# This is a very advanced feature, likely beyond initial Phase 6.
# It would involve a request body defining dimensions, metrics, filters, and groupings,
# and the backend dynamically constructing and executing the query.
# Example Request:
# { "report_name": "Custom Income Report", "dimensions": ["property.city", "financial_category.name"],
#   "metrics": ["SUM(financial_transaction.amount)"],
#   "filters": {"financial_transaction.type": "INCOME", "financial_transaction.date": {"gte": "...", "lte": "..."}},
#   "group_by": ["property.city", "financial_category.name"] }
# This requires a sophisticated query engine or ORM capabilities.

# Example (conceptual):
# @report_bp.route('/budget-vs-actual', methods=['GET'])
# def budget_vs_actual_route():
#     # budget_id = request.args.get('budget_id')
#     # ...
#     return jsonify({"report_name": "Budget vs Actual", "data": []}), 200
