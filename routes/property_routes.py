# GET /public/properties (List all publicly available properties)
def list_public_vacancies(): # ... (As per Phase 4)
    # TODO: Implement logic to list publicly available properties with advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination.
    #
    # Query Parameters:
    #   - Filtering:
    #     - `city` (string, exact match or case-insensitive like)
    #     - `county` (string, exact match or case-insensitive like)
    #     - `property_type` (string, from PropertyType enum, e.g., "APARTMENT", "HOUSE")
    #     - `min_bedrooms` (integer, e.g., properties with bedrooms >= min_bedrooms)
    #     - `max_bedrooms` (integer, e.g., properties with bedrooms <= max_bedrooms)
    #     - `min_price` (decimal/float, e.g., properties with rent >= min_price)
    #     - `max_price` (decimal/float, e.g., properties with rent <= max_price)
    #     - `status` (string, from PropertyStatus enum, e.g., "LISTED", "VACANT" - default to "LISTED" or "AVAILABLE")
    #   - Sorting:
    #     - `sort_by` (string, e.g., "price_asc", "price_desc", "date_listed_asc", "date_listed_desc", "bedrooms_asc", "bedrooms_desc")
    #   - Pagination:
    #     - `page` (integer, default 1)
    #     - `per_page` (integer, default 10 or 20)
    #
    # Logic:
    # 1. Parse and validate all query parameters.
    # 2. Construct a base query for properties that are publicly listed (e.g., status='LISTED' or is_publicly_listed=True).
    # 3. Apply filters based on provided parameters (city, county, type, bedrooms, price).
    #    - For numeric ranges (bedrooms, price), handle min, max, or exact values.
    #    - For string fields, consider case-insensitive matching.
    # 4. Apply sorting based on `sort_by` parameter.
    # 5. Apply pagination.
    # 6. Execute query and return list of property summaries suitable for public view.
    #    (Ensure sensitive landlord-specific info is not included).
    #    Each summary should include: property_id, address_line_1, city, county, property_type,
    #    num_bedrooms, num_bathrooms, rent_amount (if applicable), main_photo_url, latitude, longitude.
    #
    # Response: List of property summaries, including pagination metadata (total_items, total_pages, current_page, per_page).

# GET /public/properties/{vacancy_listing_url_slug} (View a single public property listing)
def get_public_vacancy_details(vacancy_listing_url_slug: str): # ... (As per Phase 4)
    # TODO: Implement logic to retrieve full details for a specific public vacancy.
    # Response should include all relevant public fields from Property model,
    # including address, type, rooms, amenities, description, photos_urls, main_photo_url,
    # latitude, longitude, and public listing specific fields.
    pass

# POST /public/properties/{property_id}/inquire (Prospective tenant submits an inquiry for a property)
def submit_prospect_inquiry(property_id: int): # ... (As per Phase 4)

# --- Landlord Management of Inquiries (Phase 4) ---
# GET /landlord/inquiries # ... (As per Phase 4)
def list_landlord_inquiries(): pass
# GET /landlord/inquiries/{inquiry_id} # ... (As per Phase 4)
def get_landlord_inquiry_details(inquiry_id: int): pass
# PUT /landlord/inquiries/{inquiry_id}/status # ... (As per Phase 4)
def update_landlord_inquiry_status(inquiry_id: int): pass

# Note: Direct syndication actions like POST /properties/{id}/syndicate/{platform_id} are now in syndication_routes.py.
# However, updating listing details here might trigger background syndication tasks based on LandlordSyndicationSetting.

# Example (conceptual):
# @property_bp.route('/<int:property_id>', methods=['GET'])
# def get_landlord_property_route(property_id):
#     # property = Property.query.get(property_id)
#     # check_ownership(property.landlord_id)
#     # return jsonify(property.to_dict_with_listing_and_syndication_settings()), 200
#     pass
