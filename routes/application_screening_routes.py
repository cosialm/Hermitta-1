# Actual implementation would use a web framework like Flask or FastAPI

# POST /rental-applications/{application_id}/screenings (Landlord initiates a screening check)
def initiate_application_screening(application_id: int):
    # TODO: Implement logic for Landlord to initiate a screening check for an application.
    # Landlord only, for applications on their properties.

    #   - For manual checks (MANUAL_REFERENCE_CHECK, MANUAL_EMPLOYER_CHECK):

    #     - reference_contact_details (optional string - phone/email)
    #     - screening_notes (optional initial notes, e.g., "To call on Monday")
    #   - For integrated checks:
    #     - provider_name (optional, if multiple providers for a type)
    # Creates an ApplicationScreening record with status PENDING_REQUEST or REQUESTED.
    # If integrated, this might trigger an async API call to an external screening provider.
    # Response: Details of the created ApplicationScreening record.

# GET /rental-applications/{application_id}/screenings (Landlord views screening status and results for an application)

    # Response: Full ApplicationScreening details, including screening_notes, report_summary,
    #           and info about linked screening_report_document_id (e.g., URL to download via Document service).

    #   - screening_notes (text, e.g., summary of a reference call)
    #   - report_summary (text, overall summary of the check)
    #   - screening_report_document_id (optional int, ID of an uploaded document from Document service)
    #   - completed_at (optional timestamp)
    # For callbacks, request body is provider-specific. Logic would parse it and map to these fields.

# (POST /screenings/{screening_id}/upload-report - Alternative/dedicated endpoint for report upload)
# def upload_screening_report_document(screening_id: int):
