# POST /leases/{lease_id}/amendments (Create a new lease amendment)
def create_lease_amendment(lease_id: int):
    # TODO: Implement logic to create a new lease amendment.
    # 1. Authorize: Ensure current user (landlord/staff) has rights to amend this lease.
    # 2. Validate lease_id: Ensure lease exists and is in a state that allows amendment (e.g., ACTIVE).
    # 3. Request Body:
    #    - effective_date (date)
    #    - reason (Optional[str])
    #    - Fields for changes (e.g., new_rent_amount, new_end_date, new_payment_day, amended_terms_details, other_changes_json)
    #    - amendment_document_id (Optional[int])
    # 4. Logic:
    #    - Fetch original lease values for fields being changed to store in original_xxx fields of the amendment.
    #    - Create LeaseAmendment object with status=LeaseAmendmentStatus.DRAFT.
    #    - Save the amendment.
    # 5. Response: Full details of the created LeaseAmendment (status DRAFT).
    pass

# GET /leases/{lease_id}/amendments (List all amendments for a specific lease)
def list_lease_amendments(lease_id: int):
    # TODO: Implement logic to list all amendments for a given lease.
    # 1. Authorize: Ensure user can view amendments for this lease.
    # 2. Fetch all LeaseAmendment records associated with lease_id.
    # 3. Order by effective_date or created_at to show history.
    # 4. Response: List of LeaseAmendment details.
    pass

# GET /amendments/{amendment_id} (View a specific lease amendment)
def get_lease_amendment_details(amendment_id: int):
    # TODO: Implement logic to get details of a specific lease amendment.
    # 1. Authorize: Ensure user can view this amendment.
    # 2. Fetch LeaseAmendment by amendment_id.
    # 3. Response: Full LeaseAmendment details.
    pass

# PUT /amendments/{amendment_id} (Update a lease amendment)
def update_lease_amendment(amendment_id: int):
    # TODO: Implement logic to update a lease amendment.
    # 1. Authorize: Ensure user can update this amendment.
    # 2. Fetch LeaseAmendment by amendment_id.
    # 3. Business Rule: Typically, only amendments in DRAFT status can be updated.
    #    If already ACTIVE or SUPERSEDED, updates might be disallowed or create a new amendment.
    # 4. Request Body: Similar to create, with fields to update.
    # 5. Update fields and save.
    # 6. Response: Full updated LeaseAmendment details.
    pass

# DELETE /amendments/{amendment_id} (Delete a lease amendment)
def delete_lease_amendment(amendment_id: int):
    # TODO: Implement logic to delete a lease amendment.
    # 1. Authorize: Ensure user can delete this amendment.
    # 2. Fetch LeaseAmendment by amendment_id.
    # 3. Business Rule: Typically, only DRAFT amendments can be deleted.
    # 4. Delete the record.
    # 5. Response: Success message or 204 No Content.
    pass

# POST /amendments/{amendment_id}/activate (Activate a lease amendment)
def activate_lease_amendment(amendment_id: int):
    # TODO: Implement logic to activate a DRAFT lease amendment.
    # 1. Authorize: Ensure user can activate this amendment.
    # 2. Fetch LeaseAmendment by amendment_id.
    # 3. Business Rule: Only DRAFT amendments can be activated.
    # 4. Logic:
    #    - Set status to LeaseAmendmentStatus.ACTIVE.
    #    - Set activated_at and activated_by_user_id.
    #    - IMPORTANT: Consider implications:
    #        - Are other active amendments for the same lease and overlapping fields superseded?
    #          (e.g., if a previous rent amendment was active, it might become SUPERSEDED).
    #        - Does this trigger updates to related systems (e.g., payment schedules, financial projections)?
    #          This logic is complex and critical.
    # 5. Save the amendment.
    # 6. Response: Updated LeaseAmendment details with ACTIVE status.
    pass

# --- System Impact and Determining Current Lease Terms ---
#
# To determine the current, legally binding terms of a lease at any given time, the system would:
# 1. Fetch the original Lease object.
# 2. Fetch all LeaseAmendment objects for that lease with status = ACTIVE.
# 3. Order these active amendments by their `effective_date` (and potentially `activated_at` or `amendment_id` as a tie-breaker).
# 4. Iterate through the ordered amendments, applying their changes sequentially to the lease data,
#    but only if the amendment's `effective_date` is on or before the date for which the terms are being checked.
#
# This logic would typically reside in a service layer function, e.g.:
# `LeaseService.get_effective_lease_details(lease_id, for_date=date.today())`
#
# This function would return a view of the lease (e.g., a dictionary or a Lease-like object)
# that reflects all active amendments up to the specified `for_date`.
#
# Key considerations for system impact:
# - Rent Calculations: Systems generating rent invoices or payment schedules must use the
#   `get_effective_lease_details()` to determine the correct rent_amount and payment_day_of_month
#   based on the amendment's `effective_date`.
# - Lease Expiry & Renewals: The lease expiry date used by renewal reminders or status checks
#   must be sourced from the effective lease details.
# - Reporting: Financial or occupancy reports need to accurately reflect amended terms.
# - Audit Trail: The history of amendments itself provides an audit trail of changes.
#   The `AuditLog` model should also record the creation, activation, and updates to amendments.
