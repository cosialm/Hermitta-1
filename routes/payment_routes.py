# Placeholder for Payment API Endpoints (Phase 2: Online Payments & Communication)
# Actual implementation would use a web framework like Flask or FastAPI

# --- Manual Payment Recording (from Phase 1, refined) ---
# POST /payments/manual (Landlord records a manual payment)
def record_manual_payment():
    # TODO: Implement logic for a landlord to manually record a payment.
    # Landlord only (recorded_by_landlord_id from authenticated user).
    # Request: { lease_id, payment_date, amount_paid,
    #            payment_method (e.g. "CASH_TO_LANDLORD", "MPESA_TO_LANDLORD_MANUAL"),
    #            reference_number (optional), notes (optional) }
    # Creates/Updates a Payment record with status COMPLETED.
    # Response: Full details of the recorded payment.
    pass

# --- M-Pesa Online Payment Integration (New for Phase 2) ---
# POST /leases/{lease_id}/initiate-mpesa-payment (Tenant initiates STK push for a lease)
def initiate_mpesa_payment_for_lease(lease_id: int):
    # TODO: Implement logic for an authenticated tenant to initiate M-Pesa STK push.
    # Tenant only, for their active lease.
    # 1. Checks if landlord has active M-Pesa configuration (LandlordMpesaConfiguration).
    # 2. Creates/retrieves an 'EXPECTED' or 'PENDING_CONFIRMATION' Payment record for the lease's current due amount.
    #    (Payment.expected_amount, Payment.due_date are key).
    # 3. Generates a unique merchant_request_id.
    # 4. Creates an MpesaPaymentLog entry with PENDING_STK_PUSH status, linking to the Payment record ID if applicable.
    # 5. Calls M-Pesa STK Push API with landlord's credentials, amount, tenant's phone, callback URL, merchant_request_id.
    # 6. Updates MpesaPaymentLog with checkout_request_id and status (STK_PUSH_SUCCESSFUL/FAILED) from M-Pesa response.
    # 7. If STK push initiated successfully, updates Payment status to PENDING_CONFIRMATION and links MpesaPaymentLog.log_id.
    # Request: { amount (optional, defaults to amount_due on lease), phone_number (optional, defaults to user's phone for STK) }
    # Response: { success, message, merchant_request_id, checkout_request_id (if successful) }
    pass

# POST /mpesa/callback (External M-Pesa callback endpoint - platform-wide or landlord-specific if supported)
def mpesa_stk_callback():
    # TODO: Implement logic to handle M-Pesa STK push callback.
    # This is an external, unauthenticated endpoint hit by M-Pesa.
    # IMPORTANT: Validate the source/authenticity of the callback if possible (e.g., IP whitelisting, request signature if provided by M-Pesa).
    # 1. Parses the M-Pesa JSON payload from the callback.
    # 2. Finds the corresponding MpesaPaymentLog record using checkout_request_id from the payload.
    # 3. Updates MpesaPaymentLog with callback_payload, mpesa_receipt_number, amount_paid, transaction_date,
    #    and status (PAYMENT_CONFIRMED_CALLBACK or PAYMENT_FAILED_CALLBACK).
    # 4. If payment successful (ResultCode is 0 in callback):
    #    a. Finds/Updates the associated Payment record: status to COMPLETED, amount_paid, payment_date, payment_method to MPESA_ONLINE_STK.
    #    b. Triggers notification (using Notification model) to tenant and landlord.
    #    c. (Future) Potentially updates lease balance or generates a financial transaction.
    # 5. If payment failed (non-zero ResultCode or other error indicators):
    #    a. Updates Payment record status to FAILED.
    #    b. Triggers notification to tenant (and possibly landlord).
    # Response: Acknowledgement to M-Pesa (e.g., {"ResultCode": 0, "ResultDesc": "Accepted"}).
    pass

# --- General Payment Viewing ---
# GET /payments (List payments - with filters)
def list_payments():
    # TODO: Implement logic to list payments.
    # For Landlord: All payments related to their leases/properties (Payment records).
    # For Tenant: Payments they made or are expected for their leases.
    # Query Params: lease_id, property_id, status (e.g., "COMPLETED", "PENDING_CONFIRMATION", "EXPECTED"),
    #               payment_method, date_range (for due_date or payment_date).
    # Response: List of Payment records.
    pass

# GET /payments/{payment_id} (Get specific payment details)
def get_payment_details(payment_id: int):
    # TODO: Implement logic to get details of a specific payment.
    # Accessible by Landlord or Tenant involved in the payment.
    # Response: Full Payment details, may include linked MpesaPaymentLog info if applicable (e.g., mpesa_receipt_number).
    pass

# GET /mpesa-transactions (Landlord views their M-Pesa transaction logs)
def list_landlord_mpesa_transactions():
    # TODO: Implement logic for Landlord to view their MpesaPaymentLog entries.
    # Landlord only (landlord_id from MpesaPaymentLog via Lease -> Property -> Landlord, or direct if added).
    # Query Params: lease_id, status (MpesaLogStatus), date_range, mpesa_receipt_number.
    # Response: List of MpesaPaymentLog records.
    pass

# Example (conceptual):
# from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify
# # from ..models.payment import Payment, PaymentMethod, PaymentStatus
# # from ..models.mpesa_payment_log import MpesaPaymentLog
#
# payment_bp = Blueprint('payments', __name__, url_prefix='/payments')

#
# @payment_bp.route('/leases/<int:lease_id>/initiate-mpesa', methods=['POST'])
# def initiate_mpesa_route(lease_id): # ...
#     return jsonify({"message": "M-Pesa STK push initiated"}), 200
#
# @mpesa_callbacks_bp.route('/stk', methods=['POST']) # e.g. /callbacks/mpesa/stk
# def stk_callback_route(): # ...
#     # data = request.get_json()
#     # Process M-Pesa callback data, update MpesaPaymentLog and Payment records
#     return jsonify({"ResultCode": 0, "ResultDesc": "Accepted"}), 200
#
# # ... other payment listing/details routes ...
