# POST /webhooks/payment/pesapal (Callback/IPN from Pesapal)
def pesapal_webhook_handler():
    # TODO: Implement Pesapal webhook (callback and/or IPN) handling.
    # Pesapal uses two main parameters for callbacks/IPNs:
    # - PesapalMerchantReference (our internal unique ID for the transaction)
    # - PesapalTransactionTrackingId (Pesapal's unique ID for the transaction)
    #
    # Logic:
    # 1. AUTHENTICATION/VERIFICATION:
    #    - Pesapal IPNs might not be signed. Relies on the uniqueness of the Notification ID if using IPN v2.
    #    - Check source IP if Pesapal provides a list of their IPs (less reliable).
    #    - The most reliable way is often to take the received refs and make a direct server-to-server
    #      Transaction Status Query API call back to Pesapal to confirm the status of the
    #      `PesapalTransactionTrackingId` and `PesapalMerchantReference`. This prevents spoofing.
    #
    # 2. Parse Request Data:
    #    - Get `PesapalMerchantReference` and `PesapalTransactionTrackingId` from query parameters or request body
    #      (Pesapal API docs will specify this for the specific version - v2 or v3).
    #
    # 3. Find GatewayTransaction:
    #    - Query `GatewayTransaction` table for a record with:
    #      `gateway_type` = PESAPAL
    #      `gateway_merchant_ref` = PesapalMerchantReference
    #      (Optionally, also match `gateway_transaction_ref` = PesapalTransactionTrackingId if already stored from initiation)
    #    - If no matching transaction, log an error/warning (potential issue or unmatched callback) and return appropriate response.
    #    - If transaction already processed (e.g., status is SUCCESSFUL or FAILED), ignore duplicate callback (idempotency).
    #
    # 4. Query Pesapal for Status (Highly Recommended if not already done or if initial callback is just a notification):
    #    - Call Pesapal's "GetTransactionStatus" API endpoint using the
    #      `PesapalTransactionTrackingId` and/or `PesapalMerchantReference`.
    #    - This API call will require authentication (OAuth Bearer Token with Pesapal).
    #    - The response from this API call is the source of truth for the transaction status.
    #
    # 5. Update GatewayTransaction and Payment Records:
    #    - Based on the verified status from Pesapal's GetTransactionStatus API:
    #      - `status`: Update `GatewayTransaction.status` (e.g., SUCCESSFUL, FAILED, PENDING).
    #      - `payment_method_used`: Pesapal provides this (e.g., "MPESA", "VISA", "MASTERCARD", "AIRTEL"). Store in `GatewayTransaction.payment_method_used`.
    #      - `gateway_transaction_ref`: Ensure this is stored if it wasn't from initiation.
    #      - `callback_payload`: Store the relevant parts of the GetTransactionStatus response or original callback.
    #      - `error_code`/`error_message`: If failed.
    #    - If the payment is successful:
    #      - Update the main `Payment` record (linked via `GatewayTransaction.payment_id`):
    #        - `status` to COMPLETED (or your equivalent).
    #        - `payment_date` to current time.
    #        - `payment_method_detail` (e.g., "VISA via Pesapal").
    #      - Call `process_successful_payment(payment_id)`: This service function would handle
    #        updating lease balances, sending receipts/notifications, etc.
    #    - If the payment failed:
    #      - Update `Payment.status` to FAILED.
    #      - Call `process_failed_payment(payment_id)`: Notify user of failure.
    #
    # 6. Respond to Pesapal:
    #    - For IPN v2, Pesapal expects a specific response string depending on the notification type
    #      (e.g., "pesapal_notification_type=CHANGE&pesapal_transaction_tracking_id=TRACKID&pesapal_merchant_reference=REF").
    #      Consult Pesapal docs for the exact string required for the specific IPN/Webhook version being used.
    #    - For simple callbacks, an HTTP 200 OK might suffice.

# POST /webhooks/payment/flutterwave (Example for another gateway)
def flutterwave_webhook_handler():
    # TODO: Implement Flutterwave webhook handling.
    # 1. Verify webhook signature (Flutterwave sends a secret hash in headers).
    # 2. Parse payload.
    # 3. Update GatewayTransaction and Payment records.
    # 4. Respond with HTTP 200 OK.

# POST /webhooks/payment/stripe (Example for another gateway)
def stripe_webhook_handler():
    # TODO: Implement Stripe webhook handling.
    # 1. Verify webhook signature (Stripe sends a signature in headers, use SDK to verify).
    # 2. Parse event object from payload.
    # 3. Handle different event types (e.g., 'payment_intent.succeeded', 'charge.failed').
    # 4. Update GatewayTransaction and Payment records.
    # 5. Respond with HTTP 200 OK.
